Terrible ransomware as far as ransomware comes (in terms of effectiveness). Its not supposed to be malicious (however, I hold no responsibiltiy if you misuse it or if you cant get files back.). That asside, its a java program that encrypts your files with a ceaser cypher (Woah, thats like, the most secure algorithm, forget AES or RSA ;P). Either way, it makes you play a game, if you win, it restores your files, otherwise... nothing, just keep at it :P
